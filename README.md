# Real-Time Chat Project

This project is a real-time chat application developed with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Material UI**, and **Vite**. It uses **GraphQL** for queries, mutations and subscriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript superset that adds static typing.
- **Material UI**: Component library for building modern and accessible user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast and efficient build tool for frontend projects.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for the API.
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client for integrating the API into the frontend.
- **Styled Components / sx prop**: For handling styles.
- **Codegen**: Tool to automatically generate code from a GraphQL schema. In this project, **GraphQL Code Generator** is used to generate TypeScript types from GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions, ensuring that the code is in sync with the API schema and helping to avoid type errors. It also facilitates the integration of GraphQL with the client, improving code productivity and maintainability.
